# Memory Card

The game Memory Card is designed to test your short-term memory. In this game, the player is to select each card in a given handful of cards once. However, the trick is that every time the player chooses a card all the cards are shuffled challenging the player's memory.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to implement the concepts learned in the React course of the Odin Project curriculum, so far by using hooks to manage and utilize state while fetching and using data from an external API.
